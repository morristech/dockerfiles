# gcc-runner

For one of my classes, our C programs are supposed to be compiled on a linux system with `gcc`. I'm using this docker image for that purpose. It will include all `.c` files in the source directory.

`docker-gcc` run without any arguments assumes you are in the source directory, or you can pass the source dir as an argument.
