# gcc-runner

For one of my classes, our C programs are supposed to be compiled on a linux system with `gcc`. I'm using this docker image for that purpose.

`docker-gcc` can be located outside the project dir and run with the src dir being the first argument (`docker-gcc ./`), or located inside the project dir and run without any arguments.
